An addon to Hex Casting that lets you embed extracted villager minds into yourself to make conditional hexes, or into other villagers to merge and upgrade them. Inspired by a certain concept from the Foundryside trilogy.

Insert minds into yourself by laying on an Imbuement Bed and flaying a master-level villager into the bed block. You can then configure the minds to cast hexes for you based on various trigger conditions (when I take damage, when I break a block, etc). With enough minds, you can have an automated reponse set up for any eventuality!

Insert minds into a villager by letting it sleep on the Imbuement Bed and flaying any other villager into the bed block. The sleeping villager's level will be increased by one tier, and all the trade offers from the flayed villager will be transferred into the sleeping one. You can use this to easily upgrade villagers for other flay recipes, or to merge entire trading halls into a single villager!
