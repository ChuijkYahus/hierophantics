An addon to Hex Casting that lets you embed extracted villager minds into your own to conditionally execute hexes. Inspired by a certain concept from the Foundryside trilogy.

Insert minds by laying on an Imbuement Bed and flaying a master-level villager into the bed block. You can then configure the minds to cast hexes for you based on various trigger conditions (when I take damage, when I break a block, etc). With enough minds, you can have an automated reponse set up for any eventuality!
